[2020-07-15 02:40:08] {subscriber=0, sub-gifter=1} <cor_dite> Who cares what you do - be humble and give 100% to any job you do! Every job progresses society. Look at what's happening now with COVID-19. All the jobs considered important and make the most money are mostly marked as unessential. It's been stripped back to the jobs like supermarkets and gas stations. Every job matters homie
