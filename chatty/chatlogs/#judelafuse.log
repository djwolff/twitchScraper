[2020-07-15 14:00:30] {vip=1, subscriber=3000, sub-gifter=1} <TheBlindLycan> high damage no defense, therefore u need people to peel for you
[2020-07-15 14:00:33] {subscriber=0} <suprememoonbeam> that's why it's important to position right especially for AD carry

[2020-07-15 14:01:43] {vip=1, subscriber=3000, sub-gifter=1} <TheBlindLycan> watch Yung Lycan destroy these goons with his Legendary Vayne

[2020-07-15 14:04:25] {subscriber=0} <larspa1> dont get me wrong, but my grandparents are a bit crippled and my grandma want to maintain the garden on her own, so I offered to do it but first she denied. I understand that it is due to the harsh truth of them becoming more and more physically dependent on others and the frustrating part of it
[2020-07-15 14:05:02] {subscriber=0} <larspa1> but it's just them ignoring the danger of messing up by gravity
[2020-07-15 14:05:14] {bits=100} <anon_anonymity> all old people are like that tho mostly they will push and push until they get the job done cause they dont wana cower
[2020-07-15 14:05:26] {subscriber=0} <larspa1> get messed up by gravity*
