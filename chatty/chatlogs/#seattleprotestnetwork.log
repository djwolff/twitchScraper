[2020-07-15 13:58:47] {premium=1} <Moonspeak721> for some reason the white lady with dreds at the cop rally seems really out of place
[2020-07-15 13:59:08] {subscriber=0, premium=1} <ursonate> they've actually walked about 5 or 6, but you know people run marathons
[2020-07-15 13:59:34] {} <giantsraiderswarriors> Pretty soon they'll be in Oregon.

[2020-07-15 14:15:46] {} <rowdyegg> also very ironic that the only time they have shown up to demonstrate is when they are about to loose their jobs. They don't care about community, they care about their paycheck
